Project- LockedMe.com
Developer - Manan Soni

Objective
Develop a command-line prototype of the LockedMe.com application, implementing file management operations and using Java programming language. The application will be developed incrementally using the Scrum framework and stored in a GitHub repository for version control.

Deliverables
1. Specification Document
2. Sprint Plan and Tasks
3. GitHub Repository Setup and Code Push
4. Implementation of Java Concepts and Data Structures
5. Core Features and Operations

Features of the Application
1. Display welcome screen with application name and developer details.
2. Retrieve file names in ascending order.
3. Business-level operations:
    - Add a user-specified file.
    - Delete a user-specified file.
    - Search for a user-specified file.
4. Navigation options to return to the main context or close the application.
5. Handle invalid inputs gracefully without exiting or throwing exceptions.

Tools and Technologies
- IDE: Eclipse
- Programming Language: Java
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

Core Concepts and Algorithms
- Java Concepts: Exceptions, Collections, File I/O
- Data Structures: Arrays or Lists for file storage
- Algorithms: Sorting (e.g., Arrays.sort()), Searching (e.g., Linear Search)


Conclusion
- Enhancements: Future improvements can include a GUI interface, enhanced security features, and integration with cloud storage.
- USPs: Simple command-line interface, efficient file operations, and robust error handling.
